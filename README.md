# JSP to JSF

# Readme for Thesis Code (Updated 3/27/20)
To execute the code, you have to use `Eclipse`, and run the `JSFtoJSF.java`, which will read the `index.jsp` file and the result will be printed in the `test.txt` file (I will change the format of the file in the future)
It is a very short example were only the HTML tags are manipulated, the project will grow from here.
